To install, run "./setup.py install". This will install both the python
module and the send_osc/dump_osc scripts.

By default, pyliblo is built from the supplied C file, which includes a
patch to make it compile without some annoying (but harmless) warnings.
To rebuild from the original Pyrex source, remove src/liblo.c, then pass
'--with-pyrex' to setup.py.

See doc/API.html and doc/examples.html for API documentation and some
example code.
