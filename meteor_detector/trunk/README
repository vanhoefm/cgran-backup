This Gnu Radio flow-graph implements a simple meteor-detector receiver intended for VHF meteor detection
  via the forward-scatter technique.
  
To install, simply "make install".  This will copy the appropriate bits into $HOME/bin -- it DOES NOT
  install in the system directories.  This flow-graph assumes that you've already installed the
  gr-osmosdr RTL source blocks in your Gnu Radio installation.  The flow-graph can optionally be
  reconfigured to use UHD devices--which requires that the .grc file be brought into GRC, and the
  UHD block enabled, and the rtl-sdr block disabled.
    
The flow-graph has two components: meteor_detector.py and meteor_helper.py which provides data
  recording functions.  The starter script, meteor_detector arranges to have $HOME/bin brought into
  your search path dynamically, but if you want to edit the flow-graph you'll have to arrange for
  PYTHONPATH to contain $HOME/bin prior to launching GRC.
  
The starter script creates $HOME/meteor_data if it doesn't already exist, and that's where it puts
  data files.  Several data files are produced as the program runs:
  
    met-daily?-YYYYMMDD.dat

Where '?' is the channel number.  This contains a 24-hour low-time-resolution data log.

Files produced from an event look like

   met-det?-HHMM-YYYYMMDD.dat

Where '?' is the channel number and 'HHMM' is the hours/minutes time at the time of the event.

If you've enabled Baseband Recording, then there will be corresponding:

   met-bb?-HHMM-YYYYMMDD.dat
   
Which correspond to the detector data files.  These are complex-baseband data, sampled at 2.5Ksps, using
  the standard Gnu Radio complex-float raw binary format.
  
In operation you choose a center frequency, and then configure 3 channels that are within +/- 'samp-rate/2'
  of the nominal center frequency.  The default sample rate is 1Msps.  For many observing situations
  you only have 1 active channel, but for example, if you're observing FM, you may find that you can
  find 3 "clear" channels within 1 or 2Mhz of each other.
  
The pre-detector bandwidth for each channel is configurable from 500Hz to 3KHz, and post-detector gain
  is also configurable from 1 to 50.
  
Detection theshold may be configured on the main tab.  When the detection algorithm "triggers", it
  dumps 60 seconds of "history" of the signal prior to the trigger point.  This helps produce a better
  overall picture of the "shape" of an event.

There are 3 "analyser" applications that come with this package:
================================================================

meteor_bb_analyser <filename>

This application takes a met-bb?-HHMM-YYYMMDD.dat file, and produces a PNG image of a waterfall
  spectrogram, showing the inner 250Hz of the captured baseband data.
  
meteor_det_analyser <filename>

This application takes a met-det?-HHMM-YYYYMMDD.dat file or a met-daily?-YYMMDD.dat file and produces
  a PNG image of a graph of detector power over time.
  
meteor_rate_analyser <filename>

This application takes a met-daily?-YYYYMMDD.dat file and produces a graph showing estimate event rates
  over time.
