Requirements
------------

The following code must be available in the GNU Radio core:

gnuradio-core/src/lib/gengen/gr_moving_average_vff.*
gnuradio-core/src/lib/general/gr_stream_to_vector_overlap.*

These files have been submitted and are currently (Feb 09) under revision.
As long as they're not available in the trunk, they are available as patches in the
'patch' subdir.

You can simply patch your system by calling

$ patch -p0 < gr-specest/patch/patch_*

Building and installing:
-----------------------

The usual GNU build process applies:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
sudo make install
