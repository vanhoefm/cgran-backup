Spectral Estimation Toolbox for GNU Radio
=========================================

This toolbox enhances GNU Radio with features for spectral estimation.


Python usage:
-------------

Run
>>> from gnuradio import gr,specest
to get access to the features.

E.g. specest.welch() gives you a processing block to use Welch's method for nonparametric
spectral estimation.


Specific Documentation:
-----------------------
Can be found in the Doxygen docblocks.


Feature list:
-------------
specest_welch: Non-parametric spectral estimation using Welch's method. All major
               parameters can be changed, thus implicitly making Bartlett's method
               or any other Periodogram-based estimation available.



Roadmap:
--------
Here's stuff we'd like to have, and might implement if and when we feel like it:
- Maximum Likelihood approximations (Stoica, Thomson Multitaper)
- Parametric stuff based on the Yule-Walker equations

Collaborators welcome :)
