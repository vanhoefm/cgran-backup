This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree with
wrappers for integrating IT++ into GNU Radio.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost and
cppunit.
Of course, it depends on IT++, precisely, the -dev versions of IT++.
On Ubuntu, the package you need is called libitpp-dev.

If you're building from a repository, you'll need to use this sequence,
since the version control doesn't contain configure or the generated
Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
