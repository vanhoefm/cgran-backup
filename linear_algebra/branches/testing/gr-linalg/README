Please note this is still work in progress, 
that's why it's still in the testing branch.
In order to build this you'll need lapack and blas installed.
Currently you need to make sure they're installed yourself, until I figure out
how to do this with autotools. 
If you have any suggestions feel free to contact
me. 
Up to now this is just planned as convenient C++ wrappers without python
wrappers, since NumPy and SciPy already exist for this.

If you're building from svn, you'll need to use this sequence, since
svn doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
