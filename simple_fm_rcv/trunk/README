This is a "simple" (ha!) FM Stereo receiver.

To install:

make install

This installs all the relevant pieces in $HOME/bin rather than in the system paths.

You'll need to make sure that your PATH variable includes $HOME/bin
Your PYTHONPATH (again in your .bashrc) should include $HOME/bin

You start the app using simple_fm_rcv, which relies on a .py file that is
  produced by pulling simple_fm_rcv.grc into gnuradio-companion and
  doing a "build".  The flowgraph by default disables RDS, and uses
  an osmo-rtl source.  If you're using UHD, disable the osmosdr source
  and the couple of blocks after it, and enable the UHD source.  Once you've
  modified the simple_fm_rcv.grc, and built it from within GRC, do a "make install".

The simple_fm_rcv takes a "--help option".

This assumes that you've installed the gr-osmosdr stuff into your Gnu Radio
  environment.  The current version of build-gnuradio does this for you.
