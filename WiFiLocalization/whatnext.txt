What's next?

Simulator:
* Recreate simulator's "Connect to solver" client code and socket management
* Provide simulator GUI feature for creating a new Intruder
-> Menu command creates a pop-up window with:
  -> a place to enter the Intruder's location
  -> a dropdown to select which Pattern you want
  -> a place to enter other Pattern parameters (the number of steps to take, the velocity, etc for SquarePattern1)
* Make sure everything is connected (right now it is not)
* Make sure everything works 

Solver:
* Move Triplet related functions into a new Triplet class, they are currently in Measurement and Packetlist
* Make aggregator output Triplets (and finish it)
* Build localization algorithm to turn a Triplet into a Measurement
* Check buffer structure that is used to pass Packets to the aggregator and Measurements to the GUI
* Make sure everything is connected
* Make sure everything works 

Sensor:
* Grab "pktdump" code from the lab 
* Rebuild/uncomment TCP related functions

Later:
* Dynamic parameter setting
* Multiple path loss models
* Better documentation
* Better pop up boxes
* Faster button picture updates (don't delete/make new bitmap class)
* TEST IT MORE
* See if Ryan/Saul can understand documentation
* Clean up code comments and remove junk
