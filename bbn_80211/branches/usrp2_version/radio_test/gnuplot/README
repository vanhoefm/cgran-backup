gnuplot.py: This is the one most likely to be useful.  It basically
takes a gr_complex dump file (using a gr.file_sink) and converts it
into a gnuplot readable ".dat" file.  The function proc does the
conversion using Python's nifty struct class.  There is also a
gnuplot_stuff procedure that can be used to pipe results to gnuplot.


nrt_graph.py:  This is the original GUI I used for Space VPN
demonstration last year.  It spins up a GUI and logs some data to it
as well as plotting data in "real-time" to gnuplot.


I hope this helps.  Make sure to do a sanity check on them to make
sure they are doing what you expect.

Gnuplot like this:
 plot [0:3000] "out.dat" using 1:2 title 'real', "out.dat" using 1:3 title 'imag'
