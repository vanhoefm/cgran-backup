NetBSD, as of 20060724, has ACERT-funded changes to allow read ahead
and write behind on ugen(4), resulting in far better USRP performance.
To get the better performance, one also needs fusb_netbsd, described
below.

The fusb_netbsd directory contains a new fusb driver that works with
the NetBSD ugen driver changes.  The fusb.patch should be applied at
the root of the new gnuradio subversion tree (patch -p0 < fusb.patch)
and the files in host/lib should be added to usrp/host/lib/. Then run
./bootstrap and ./configure again.

The usrp_data2xplot program simply creates an xplot input file from
the output produced by "test_usrp_standard_rx -c -o <output file>".
If there is a data overrun, numbers will be missing from the
incrementing sequence generated by the FPGA; usrp_data2xplot
represents sequential numbers by "1" and fills in numbers missing from
the sequence as green "2" values.  If used with the default 128 MB
file, the resulting xplot file is probably too large (head -2000000
worked well for me).

This can't really be used with data that was sent to the USRP and read
back through loopback; if there are underruns in the transmit
direction, then the data read back will contain a lot of repeat values
filled in during the underrun, and the resulting xplot file would be
enormous and not very interesting.
