ubiquiti card as ath1
all settings default unless otherwise noted.
bootup state:

  hw.ath1.smoothing_rate = 95
  hw.ath1.sample_rate = 10
  hw.ath1.countrycode = 0
  hw.ath1.debug = 0
  hw.ath1.slottime = 20
  hw.ath1.acktimeout = 48
  hw.ath1.ctstimeout = 48
  hw.ath1.softled = 0

~6" MMCX-N jumper to Anritsu spectrum analyzer, set for 22 MHz channel,
peak hold with multiple minute integration time.

maxtxpower	dBm
tpc=0		26.5
38		26.5
0		15.1
10		14.8
20		18.0
25		19.8
30		21.7
34		23.7
38		27.0

25		20.5

Other experiments:

* Setting tpack, tpcts to 0 did not affect results.
* Setting maxtxpower to -1 was like max, read back as 63.
* Setting tpscale to 1 or 4 did not appear to affect results.
* Setting txantenna to 1 did not affect results
* Setting txantenna to 2 moved most tx power to 2nd connector
* Setting diversity to 0 made antenna not selected by txantenna
  essentially 0


Other observations:

Transmitted noise floor on adjacent channels was about -35 dBm/100 kHz
(if we are reading the scale of power per bin and resolution bandwidth
correctly).   This corresponds to -12 dBm total noise in the band,
which comprares reasonably with +25 dBm total power.

The transmitted signal quality degrades a lot at txpower 34 and up,
with out of band noise.
