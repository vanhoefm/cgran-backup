Bob Vincent measured a Linksys AP during the first week of October, 2006.

Linksys claims +18 dBm output.  At the end of a 100foot spool of what
I believe is LMR 400 cable, which should have an IL around 6dB, I
measured +11.7 dBm on the right antenna (farther from the power
connector) and +11.4 on the left antenna (nearer the power
connector.

The attenuator setup that we plan to use for receive characterization
appears to have approximately a 2 dB IL.
