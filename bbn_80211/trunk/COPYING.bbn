This package is based on code from GNU Radio, and thus many files bear
an FSF copyright.  BBN has modified some files, and thus there is also
a copyright statement for the resulting derivative work, generally
appearing after the FSF copyright and the grant of permission to copy
under the GPL.  By this marking placement, BBN grants permission to
copy our code under the GPL (see COPYING).
